# Decisions

- 2026-09-14: Cloud-first unified TypeScript backend with logical modules and managed Supabase services.
- 2026-09-14: Web, mobile, and desktop are clients of canonical backend state.
- 2026-09-14: AI integrations are provider-agnostic and routed through adapters.
- 2026-09-14: Bootstrap creates structure and documentation only.
- 2026-09-14: Added patch-fs.js in apps/web to normalize Windows FAT32 readlink EISDIR errors to EINVAL for Webpack module resolution.
- 2026-09-16: Formalized ADR 0002 for canonical 11-module relational schema with 100% RLS coverage and pgvector on Supabase project `vscprtuinxopistikpcs`.
- 2026-09-16: Implemented Supabase adapters in `apps/web` (Auth, StudentProfile, Curriculum) with automatic activation upon credential detection and fallback to local adapters for offline stability.
- 2026-09-18: Formalized ADR 0003 for Backend Foundation, File Subsystem, and Shared Packages Architecture. Implemented modular Express server on port 4000, JWT auth with Supabase getUser verification, role and tenant isolation middleware, Supabase Storage signed URLs with `file_assets` metadata tracking, full-text search, and shared `@sharpmind/types` and `@sharpmind/api-client` packages.


- 2026-10-17: Formalized ADR 0009 for required one-time student profile setup after verified email: globally case-insensitive usernames, distinct profile_setup_completed state, and service-role-only atomic completion RPC.
- 2026-10-18: Formalized ADR 0010 for signup availability and transient notification UX. Supabase confirmation signup enters OTP input directly to avoid sending a second OTP; email availability uses a response-minimized POST and username availability is authenticated while DB constraints remain authoritative; global actionable toasts auto-dismiss after five seconds.
