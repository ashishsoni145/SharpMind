    description: 'Before jumping in, SharpMind assesses what you already know. Quick diagnostic assessments establish your baseline, and the Student Model initialises with real evidence — not assumptions.',

    title: 'Adaptive Learning',
    description: 'Based on your Student Model, SharpMind generates a personalised learning path. It selects the right concepts, in the right order, at the right difficulty — adapting in real-time as you progress.',
    detail: 'If you\'re strong in Kinematics but weak in Rotational Dynamics, SharpMind won\'t waste time on basics you\'ve mastered. It goes straight to your gaps.',

    title: 'Practice & Assessment',
    description: 'Calibrated questions test your understanding at exactly the right level. Adaptive assessments get harder as you improve and provide targeted practice exactly where you need it.',
    detail: 'Each question response updates your Student Model: correct answers strengthen mastery, errors reveal misconceptions, and time patterns show confidence.',
    color: '#06b6d4',
  },

    number: '05',
    title: 'Mistake Capture & Analysis',
    description: 'Every mistake is a data point. SharpMind captures the full context — the question, your response, the correct answer, the underlying concept, and the likely misconception.',
    detail: 'Mistakes are categorised (conceptual error, calculation slip, misread question) and linked to specific concepts, creating a structured revision target list.',
    color: '#10b981',
  },
  {
    number: '06',
    title: 'Model Update & Backlog',
    description: 'Your Student Model continuously updates. New evidence refines mastery levels, forgetting curves predict decay, and the adaptive backlog re-prioritises what to study next.',
    detail: 'The system distinguishes between observed evidence (test results) and inferred state (predicted forgetting). Only verified data changes your core model.',
    color: '#f59e0b',
  },
  {
    number: '07',
    title: 'Spaced Revision',
    description: 'Algorithmically-timed revision sessions target concepts that are about to be forgotten. Spaced repetition ensures long-term retention without wasting time reviewing what\'s still fresh.',
    detail: 'SharpMind knows that you learned "Thermodynamics — Carnot Cycle" 12 days ago and you\'re predicted to forget it tomorrow. It schedules revision today.',
